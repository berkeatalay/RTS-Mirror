# RTS-Mirror

This will be a basis for my unity multiplayer experience. This game is part of gamedev.tv multiplayer course as I am coding along that lecture.

At the end i will try to add my twist and turn this to a semi finished game.

## Halfway Update

Up to this point, course gave me basics of how to achive networking using Mirror and especially on what are things that needs to be in client and what in server.
This was an interesting journey up to this point. I will see what will happen at the end of this journey as a hobbiest game maeker.
